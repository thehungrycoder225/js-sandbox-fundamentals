// Tony is still building his tip calculator
// Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is
// 20%

// Your tasks:
// 1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns
// the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above. Use the function
// type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100
// 2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data
// below
// 3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from
// the function you created before
// 4. Bonus: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip
// Test data: 125, 555 and 44
